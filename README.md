# Offensive-Language-Detection-DK

This is the R-code for the bachelor project of Aske Bredahl & Johan Horsmans; "Offensive Language Detection in Danish". In this tutorial we will train the following models: Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, LSTM, Bi-LSTM, C-LSTM and a CNN. Furthermore, we will design the ensemble support system described in the assignment.
