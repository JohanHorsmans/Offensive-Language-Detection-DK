# Offensive-Language-Detection-DK

This is the R-code for the bachelor project of Aske Bredahl & Johan Horsmans; "Offensive Language Detection in Danish". In this tutorial we will train the following models: Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, LSTM, Bi-LSTM, C-LSTM and a CNN. Furthermore, we will design the ensemble support system described in the assignment.

The supplied .md-file is the R-pipeline for the ensemble support system for the DKhate data in section 1 of the thesis. The model pipeline is the same for section 2 and 3 except that the data used for training/prediction varies.
